/**
 * cloudflare-workers-shim.js
 *
 * Minimal shim for the `cloudflare:workers` import that some worker
 * bundles use (e.g. `import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers"`).
 *
 * This shim is the runtime replacement for the `cloudflare:workers` module
 * in self-hosted mode (Bun.serve + server.js). It deliberately does NOT
 * provide real Cloudflare Workers semantics — it throws a clear error
 * pointing operators to the Cloudflare deployment.
 *
 * Design decision: option (a) from the 2026-06-04 Docker setup review
 * (subtask 07). "Fail loudly." This is the safest default: it surfaces
 * the limitation immediately rather than silently producing no-op
 * behavior (which was the bug in the original Dockerfile.prod polyfill).
 *
 * Operators running self-hosted for development or testing are expected
 * to either:
 *   1. Accept the limitations and use the Cloudflare deployment for
 *      production (recommended).
 *   2. Replace this shim with a real adapter (e.g. an in-memory Map-based
 *      DO, or a workerd/miniflare integration) — option (b) or (c) from
 *      the review.
 *
 * See DESIGN.md → Self-Hosted Limitations for the full picture.
