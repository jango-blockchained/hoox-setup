Authorization: Bearer {CF_API_TOKEN}
Body: { html: "...", options: { format: "A4" } }
```

## Local Development URLs

For local development with `wrangler dev`, the following service URLs are used:

| Service            | Local URL             | Used By                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| Trade Worker       | http://localhost:8789 | hoox, agent-worker, email-worker                      |

| Web3 Wallet Worker | http://localhost:8793 | trade-worker                                          |
| dashboard          | http://localhost:8794 | Users (browser)                                       |
| agent-worker       | http://localhost:8795 | dashboard                                             |
| email-worker       | http://localhost:8796 | — (cron triggered)                                    |
| report-worker      | http://localhost:8797 | — (cron triggered)                                    |

## Configuration

Each worker contains a `.dev.vars` file for local development which should be populated with the appropriate values. These files should not be committed to the repository.

Example setup for `.dev.vars` files can be found in the corresponding `.dev.vars.example` files in each worker directory.

## Setting Up Secrets

For production deployment, secrets should be set using the Wrangler CLI:

```bash
wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME
```

This will securely store the secret and make it available to the worker at runtime.
