# 📊 Signals & Trade Spec

This document details the exact specifications, JSON validation schemas, and internal translation logic that occurs when an external trade signal (such as a TradingView alert or Email parser) is ingested by the Hoox Gateway and mapped to an active exchange order.

---

## 1. Webhook Signal Ingestion Schema

Every signal received by the public gateway at `/webhook` must contain a valid, authenticated JSON payload. Below is the strict TypeScript interface and parameter schema validated by the gateway's validation middleware:

```typescript
export interface WebhookSignal {
  apiKey: string;         // Authentication token matching CONFIG_KV webhooks:api_key
  exchange: "binance" | "bybit" | "mexc";   // Target exchange router
  action: "LONG" | "SHORT" | "CLOSE";       // Position intent
  symbol: string;         // Asset symbol (e.g. "BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT")
  quantity: number;       // Order size (amount of asset or contracts)
  leverage?: number;      // Optional leverage multiplier (default: 1, max: 125)
  idempotencyKey?: string; // Optional unique signature for dedup (auto-generated if omitted)
  price?: number;         // Optional limit price (default: market price)
  takeProfit?: number;    // Optional take-profit price target
  stopLoss?: number;      // Optional stop-loss price target
}
```

### Parameter Rules & Type Constraints

| Parameter | Type | Required | Constraints |
|-----------|------|:--------:|-------------|
| `apiKey` | `string` | **Yes** | Must match the encrypted `webhooks:api_key` hash in your `CONFIG_KV` namespace |
| `exchange` | `string` | **Yes** | One of: `binance`, `bybit`, `mexc` — must match a configured exchange router |
| `action` | `string` | **Yes** | One of: `LONG` (buy/open), `SHORT` (sell/open), `CLOSE` (flatten position) |
| `symbol` | `string` | **Yes** | Parsed and standardized — `BTC-USDT`, `BTC_USDT`, and `btc/usdt` all become `BTCUSDT` |
| `quantity` | `number` | **Yes** | Must be greater than zero; checked against exchange minimum order size |
| `leverage` | `number` | No | Range: `1` to `125` depending on exchange margin profiles; defaults to `1` (spot) |
| `idempotencyKey` | `string` | No | If omitted, auto-generated from `SHA256(symbol + exchange + action + timestamp)` |
| `price` | `number` | No | Limit price; defaults to current market price if omitted |
| `takeProfit` | `number` | No | Target exit price for automatic partial close |
| `stopLoss` | `number` | No | Stop-loss trigger price; overrides agent-worker trailing stop if specified |

## 2. Dynamic Payload Translation & Side Mapping

Exchanges do not understand actions like `LONG`, `SHORT`, or `CLOSE`. They process order instructions in terms of **`Side`** (`BUY` or `SELL`) and **`PositionSide`** (`LONG` or `SHORT` for multi-margin hedge modes).

The `trade-worker` parses the incoming signal and translates the business logic into exchange-specific API calls:

### A. Translation Table (One-Way Margin / Spot)

| Action | Position State | Translated Exchange Side | Operation Type |
| :----- | :------------: | :----------------------: | :------------- |
| **`LONG`** | Closed / No Position | **`BUY`** | Opens a long position (spot or margin) |
| **`SHORT`** | Closed / No Position | **`SELL`** | Opens a short position (margin/futures) |
| **`CLOSE`** | Long Position Active | **`SELL`** | Closes and flattens an existing long position |
| **`CLOSE`** | Short Position Active | **`BUY`** | Closes and flattens an existing short position |

### B. Hedge-Mode PositionSide Mapping

When running in hedge mode (supported on Bybit and Binance futures), both LONG and SHORT positions can coexist:

```
Hedge Mode:
  LONG PositionSide = LONG  → BUY opens LONG, SELL closes LONG
  SHORT PositionSide = SHORT → SELL opens SHORT, BUY closes SHORT

One-Way Mode:
  BUY always opens/increases, SELL always closes/reduces
```

### C. Dynamic Position Resolution

When the action is **`CLOSE`**, the `trade-worker` automatically performs a sub-millisecond edge check:

1. Queries your local D1 transaction ledger to resolve the active position direction for the symbol.
2. If no position is tracked locally, it performs a real-time portfolio balance check against the exchange's private position endpoint.
3. Automatically sets the order quantity to match your current open exposure, ensuring a perfect, slippage-free execution that flattens the position without leaving residual micro-contracts.

---

## 3. Leverage Scaling & Order Math

If the signal includes a `leverage` parameter greater than `1` (e.g., `"leverage": 10`), the `trade-worker` automatically executes a secure margin transition sequence:

1. **Set Margin Mode**: Configures the symbol's margin structure (Isolated vs. Cross) via the exchange API, matching your manifest defaults.
2. **Set Leverage Coefficient**: Submits a leverage update payload to the exchange prior to routing the order.
3. **Calculate Collateral**: If the order size is defined in USDT terms, the worker scales the execution quantity mathematically:
   $$\text{Contract Quantity} = \frac{\text{Order Size (USDT)} \times \text{Leverage}}{\text{Current Market Price}}$$
4. **Precision Rounding**: Automatically rounds the calculated quantity down to match the exchange's strict asset decimal precision requirements, preventing API rejects.

### Precision Table by Exchange

| Exchange | Price Precision | Quantity Precision | Min Order Size |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Binance | Varies by symbol | Varies by symbol | ~$10 equivalent |
| Bybit | 0.1 – 0.001 | 3–6 decimal places | Varies by tier |
| MEXC | 0.1 – 0.00000001 | 2–8 decimal places | ~$5 equivalent |

## 4. D1 Database Transaction Ledger

Every filled order is persistently written to your globally distributed edge SQLite table. The schema ensures a clean audit log:

```sql
CREATE TABLE trades (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,          -- UUID v4 generated by trade-worker
  request_id TEXT NOT NULL,     -- Distributed trace ID from gateway
  exchange TEXT NOT NULL,       -- 'bybit', 'binance', or 'mexc'
  symbol TEXT NOT NULL,         -- e.g. 'BTCUSDT'
  action TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'LONG', 'SHORT', or 'CLOSE'
  side TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'BUY' or 'SELL' (exchange-side)
  quantity REAL NOT NULL,       -- Filled asset quantity
  price REAL NOT NULL,          -- Execution entry price (USDT)
  leverage INTEGER DEFAULT 1,   -- Applied leverage multiplier
  fee REAL NOT NULL,            -- Exchange transaction fees (USDT)
  order_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- Exchange-provided order hash
  status TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'Filled', 'Rejected', 'Failed', 'Partial'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE positions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  symbol TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  side TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'LONG' or 'SHORT'
  quantity REAL NOT NULL,
  entry_price REAL NOT NULL,
  mark_price REAL,              -- Last known market price
  leverage INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  unrealized_pnl REAL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

You can query the ledger at any time from your local terminal:

```bash
# Query the 10 most recent trades in your D1 database
hoox db query "SELECT created_at, exchange, symbol, action, price, quantity FROM trades ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"

# Check open positions
hoox db query "SELECT symbol, side, quantity, entry_price FROM positions WHERE quantity > 0"
```

## 5. Queue Failover & Guaranteed Delivery

When the exchange API returns an error (timeout, rate limit, HTTP 5xx), the gateway automatically enqueues the trade payload into **Cloudflare Queues** for guaranteed delivery:

| Retry Attempt | Delay | Trigger Condition |
|:------------:|:-----:|:-----------------:|
| 1 | Immediate | First failure |
| 2 | 30 seconds | Network timeout |
| 3 | 1 minute | Rate limit (429) |
| 4 | 5 minutes | Exchange error (502/503) |
| 5 | 15 minutes | Extended maintenance |
| 6 | 30 minutes | Final retry before logging as failed |

After max retries, the trade is logged to D1 with `status = 'Failed'` — not lost, but visibly flagged for manual review.

---

> **Tip:** By utilizing time-series logging via Cloudflare Analytics Engine, Hoox tracks the exact execution duration of each pipeline step. You can audit the latency breakdown (e.g., Gateway auth took `1.2ms`, Trade-worker signing took `0.8ms`, Bybit API roundtrip took `18.5ms`) directly in your Next.js dashboard!
