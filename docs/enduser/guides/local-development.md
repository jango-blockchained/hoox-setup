# 💻 Local Development

Hoox provides a comprehensive local development workspace designed to match your production Cloudflare edge environment. You can run all microservices with hot-reload enabled, monitor them visually via the Terminal UI (TUI), and execute the full test suite using native Bun tools or isolated Docker containers.

---

## 🚀 Starting the Local Workspace

To spin up all enabled workers simultaneously:

```bash
hoox dev start
```

On execution, the CLI automatically detects your environment and prompts you to select a runtime:

### Option A: Native Runtime (Recommended for speed)

- Runs each worker in a separate background thread using `wrangler dev` (the official Cloudflare local server).
- **Speed**: Instant startup and sub-millisecond hot-reloading.
- **Requirements**: Local node/bun installation.

### Option B: Docker Runtime (Recommended for isolation)

- Launches a multi-container stack using **Docker Compose**.
- **Isolation**: All environment variables, SQLite databases, and queue handlers run in isolated Linux containers, ensuring zero conflicts with local packages.
- **Requirements**: Docker Desktop installed.

> **Tip:** The CLI saves your runtime preference inside `wrangler.jsonc.dev.runtime`. Subsequent launches skip the prompt. You can override your preference at any time using flags:

```bash
# Force native execution
hoox dev start --runtime native

# Force Docker Compose execution
hoox dev start --runtime docker
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose Profiles

If you choose the Docker runtime, Hoox manages orchestration using three specialized Docker Compose profiles defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Profile 1: Workers Only (No frontend dashboard)
docker compose --profile workers up

# Profile 2: Dashboard Only (Next.js server only)
docker compose --profile dashboard up

# Profile 3: Full Stack (All workers + Next.js dashboard)
docker compose --profile full up
```

## 📍 Local Port Mapping & Endpoint Access

During local development, all enabled workers are assigned dedicated local ports, simulating service boundaries locally:

| Worker                | Local Port | Endpoint URL            | Purpose                           |
| :-------------------- | :--------: | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **`hoox`**            |   `8787`   | `http://localhost:8787` | Public Gateway & Webhook Receiver |
| **`trade-worker`**    |   `8789`   | `http://localhost:8789` | Trade Execution Engine            |
| **`telegram-worker`** |   `8791`   | `http://localhost:8791` | Telegram Bot Alerts & Commands    |
| **`d1-worker`**       |   `8792`   | `http://localhost:8792` | SQLite Database Operations        |
| **`web3-wallet`**     |   `8793`   | `http://localhost:8793` | On-Chain DeFi Execution           |
| **`dashboard`**       |   `8794`   | `http://localhost:8794` | Next.js Dashboard Cockpit         |
| **`agent-worker`**    |   `8795`   | `http://localhost:8795` | AI Risk Manager & Cron Engine     |

## 🛠️ Operating Individual Services

If you only want to work on a single microservice rather than running the full stack, you can spin up individual modules:

```bash
# Dev run a single worker (gateway)
hoox dev worker hoox

# Dev run trade-worker with hot-reloading
hoox dev worker trade-worker

# Dev run dashboard separately (Next.js dev server with Turbopack)
hoox dev dashboard
```

---

## 🧪 Running the Verification CI Pipeline

Hoox features a rigorous local test pipeline to ensure that all TypeScript types, formatting, and unit tests pass perfectly before pushing to git:

```bash
# Run the complete CI verification pipeline locally
hoox test
```

The pipeline executes four verification steps in a strict dependency sequence:

1. **Lint Check** (`bun run lint`): Validates ESLint styling rules across the monorepo.
2. **Type Check** (`bun run typecheck`): Compiles code via `tsc --noEmit` to verify type safety.
3. **Unit Tests** (`bun test`): Fires all unit and integration test assertions using Bun's native test runner.
4. **Build Check** (`bun run build`): Compiles all workspaces (`cli`, `tui`, `shared`, `dashboard`) to verify production packaging.

```
🔍 Running local CI Pipeline...
[STARTED] lint check... [PASSED]
[STARTED] TypeScript typecheck... [PASSED]
[STARTED] bun test runner... [PASSED] (1,574 assertions)
[STARTED] workspace builds... [PASSED]
✔ Local CI Pipeline Succeeded!
```

> **Note:** Local unit tests utilize Bun's native test runner for instantaneous execution. You can target specific workspace folders or run files individually: `bun test workers/trade-worker/src/index.test.ts`.
