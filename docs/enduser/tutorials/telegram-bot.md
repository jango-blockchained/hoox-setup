# 💬 Telegram Bot Setup

The **`telegram-worker`** is a central operational pillar of the Hoox trading ecosystem. It serves two critical functions:

1. **Push Notifications**: Sends instant real-time order fill alerts, daily P&L audits, and system health status updates directly to your mobile phone.
2. **Interactive Command Console**: Provides a secure chat terminal allowing you to query open positions, check D1 balance logs, and trigger the Global Kill Switch directly via Telegram chat.

This tutorial guides you through creating a bot, binding secrets, deploying the secure Cloudflare webhook, and using commands.

## 🏁 Step-by-Step Configuration Path

### Step 1: Provision a Bot via BotFather

1. Open the Telegram app and search for the verified **`@BotFather`** account.
2. Click **Start** and send the command:
   ```telegram
   /newbot
   ```
3. Enter a friendly name for your bot (e.g. `My Hoox Edge Bot`).
4. Choose a unique username ending in "bot" (e.g. `AlphaHooxTradeBot`).
5. BotFather will output your **HTTP API Token** (save this securely):
   `5829104829:AAFkL92jL-492kLl...`

---

### Step 2: Retrieve Your Private Chat ID

To ensure that only **you** can command your bot (and to prevent unauthorized users from viewing your trading balances), you must capture your private Telegram Chat ID:

1. Search for the username **`@userinfobot`** in Telegram and start a chat.
2. The bot will instantly return your numeric **Id** (e.g., `987654321`).

### Step 3: Inject Credentials via Hoox CLI

Bind your bot token and authorized Chat ID as encrypted Workers Secrets in your workspace:

```bash
# Inject the secure Telegram Bot token
hoox secrets set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN "5829104829:AAFkL92jL-492kLl..."

# Inject your authorized Telegram Chat ID
hoox secrets set TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID "987654321"
```

---

### Step 4: Register the Webhook with Telegram

To allow Telegram’s servers to route incoming chat commands straight to your edge worker, you must register your deployed gateway URL as the bot's official webhook handler:

```bash
# Automatically register the webhook endpoint with Telegram's APIs
hoox deploy telegram-webhook
```

_The CLI calls Telegram’s API to configure the route:_
`https://hoox.alpha-trading.workers.dev/telegram-webhook`

## 🕹️ Interactive Chat Commands

Open your private bot chat in Telegram, click **Start**, and send the following commands to manage your edge:

| Command          | Action             | Description                                                            |
| :--------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`/start`**     | Onboarding         | Verifies connection and returns system welcome message.                |
| **`/status`**    | System Audit       | Probes all workers and returns online/offline health status.           |
| **`/trades`**    | Transaction Log    | Retrieves a formatted table of the 5 most recent executed fills.       |
| **`/positions`** | Exposure Audit     | Lists all currently active long/short positions with unrealized P&L.   |
| **`/kill_on`**   | **Emergency Halt** | Instantly activates the Global Kill Switch in KV, halting all trading. |
| **`/kill_off`**  | Resume             | Deactivates the Global Kill Switch, restoring signal processing.       |

## 🧠 Conversational AI Chat & Chart Audits

Beyond static commands, `telegram-worker` is integrated with **Cloudflare Workers AI** and the **Multi-Provider AI Gateway**:

- **Natural Language Queries**: You can ask the bot conversational questions like _"Should I close my BTC position?"_ or _"Analyze my trade win rate today"_. The bot queries your D1 SQL database, aggregates context using Vectorize, and responds with a LLaMA-3 analytical summary.
- **Chart Image Audits**: If you upload a screenshot of a trading chart or a portfolio page, the AI Gateway uses vision models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or Gemini 1.5 Pro) to analyze the chart and return an automated risk audit.

---

> **Warning:** The `telegram-worker` strictly filters all incoming messages. If a message originates from a `Chat ID` that does not match your authorized `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` secret, it is silently dropped and logged as a security alert, ensuring your account remains 100% secure.
