## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | 1.2+ | Runtime, package manager, test runner |
| [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) | Latest | Cloudflare Workers deployment |
| [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Latest (optional) | Containerized local development |
| [GCloud/gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) | Latest (optional) | GitHub automation |

### Step-by-Step Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo on GitHub and clone your fork
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/hoox-setup.git
cd hoox-setup

# 2. Install monorepo dependencies via Bun workspaces
bun install

# 3. Copy the environment template and fill in required values
cp .env.example .env.local
cp workers/hoox/.dev.vars.example workers/hoox/.dev.vars

# 4. Bootstrap the workspace (sets up Wrangler configs, local bindings)
bun run setup

# 5. Run the full CI verification pipeline to confirm everything works
bun test

# 6. Start local development (choose runtime when prompted)
hoox dev start
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature/bugfix branch from main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# Make your changes with descriptive commits
git commit -m "feat: add retry logic for ExchangeRouter timeout handling"
git commit -m "fix: resolve idempotency key collision on rapid identical signals"

# Push and open a PR
git push origin your-branch
```

**Branch naming convention**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/` prefixes.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Full local CI pipeline (lint + typecheck + unit + build)
hoox test

# Targeted workspace tests
bun run test:cli          # CLI package tests
bun run test:tui          # Terminal UI tests
bun run test:shared       # Shared library tests
bun run test:workers      # All worker unit tests

# Single test file with watch mode
bun test workers/trade-worker/src/index.test.ts --watch

# Integration tests (requires local services)
bun run test:integration

# Live Cloudflare tests (requires credentials in tests/live/.env)
bun run test:live --jobs 1
```

### Code Style

- **Package manager**: `bun` — use `bun add`, `bun remove`, `bun run`
- **Formatter**: `prettier` — auto-formatted on pre-commit via husky
- **Linter**: `eslint` with strict TypeScript rules
- **Type safety**: `tsc --noEmit` must pass with zero errors (`strict: true`)
- **Test runner**: Bun native test runner (`bun test`)
- **No `as any`**: Use `as unknown as TargetType` for type assertions in tests
- **Secret handling**: Never commit `.env.local`, `.dev.vars`, or test credentials

### Testing Patterns

When adding tests for new features:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "bun:test";

describe("new feature description", () => {
  it("should handle expected case", async () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });

  it("should gracefully handle edge cases", async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

### Documentation Standards

- Every new feature must have corresponding documentation in `docs/`
- Update the relevant concept doc, guide, or reference file
- Add cross-references in `docs/enduser/home.md` or `docs/devops/home.md`
- Ensure all `Next Steps` links resolve to existing files
