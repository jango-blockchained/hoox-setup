/**
 * Augment @opentui/react types.
 *
 * 1. Loose JSX intrinsic element types: OpenTUI v0.2.12's `BoxProps` and `TextProps`
 *    don't include all layout/style props (fg, bg, bold, dim, flexDirection, paddingLeft, etc.)
 *    that are valid at runtime. This augmentation makes all intrinsic elements accept any props
 *    to avoid TS2322 errors throughout the codebase.
 *
 * 2. Named exports: `createRoot` and `useKeyboard` are exported from @opentui/react but
 *    may not resolve correctly through Bun's symlinked package resolution. This augmentation
 *    declares them to fix TS2305 errors.
