 * CliBridge — Spawns the hoox CLI binary and returns structured results.

 *
 * Every `CliResult` now carries `command` (the exact command string) and
 * `errorType` (a `CliErrorType` classification) so the status bar can
 * surface actionable diagnostics instead of a generic OFFLINE message.
 *
 * Global error sink: callers (e.g. the app root) can register an
 * `onError` listener once via `cliBridge.onError(fn)` and receive a
 * structured `CliErrorDetails` payload for **every** failed command —
 * not just the ones the caller explicitly invoked. This is the wiring
 * point that lets the status bar surface the real diagnostic context
 * for any CLI failure, regardless of which view triggered it.
