# Changelog

All notable changes to `@jango-blockchained/hoox-cli` are documented here.
This project adheres loosely to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.9.5] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- **`hoox monitor queue-depth`** — wrangler ≥4.x removed `queues list --json`. The command now runs the human table form and parses it for `--json` output.
- **`hoox monitor kill-switch` / KV resolve** — wrangler version banners on stdout broke `JSON.parse` and polluted KV values. Namespace list uses `extractJsonArray`; `kv get` strips banners so kill-switch reports `on`/`off` correctly.
- **`hoox check health`** — no longer uses long-lived `wrangler tail` (hung ~50s+ per worker). Probes each worker with HTTP `GET /health` (8s timeout) and reports latency.
- **`hoox db list` (local)** — root monorepo `wrangler.jsonc` is a Hoox meta-config without D1 bindings. Local D1 ops now pass `-c workers/d1-worker/wrangler.jsonc` when present (`HOOX_WRANGLER_CONFIG` override supported).
- **`hoox pine *`** — child spawns use `process.execPath` / known bun install paths instead of bare `"bun"` on PATH. Missing `workers/pine-worker` returns a clear clone hint instead of `ENOENT: posix_spawn 'bun'`.

- **`hoox repair check`** — prints a per-step status table (and full JSON with `--json`) instead of only `"N check(s) failed"`.

- **`hoox trace destinations`** — defaults to listing destinations when no subcommand is given (was help + exit 1).

## [0.9.3] — 2026-07-11

### Added

- **Dramatically extended hop-level tracing and observability for performance measurement** (key for the HOOX arXiv paper):
  - `hoox perf fastpath` now emits and reports much finer-grained hops (e.g. `hoox:hoox-gateway`, `trade-worker:trade-worker-receive`, preflight, DO mutex, binding dispatch, etc.).
  - `ObservabilityReader` improved to parse explicit `hop` fields in addition to legacy per-service timings.
  - Structured JSON logs (`probe_id`, `hop`, `duration_ms`) for easy correlation with `hoox trace` and Analytics Engine.
  - `hoox perf fastpath report` and `hoox trace` now support detailed per-hop reconstruction and full trace timelines.
  - Added rich hop breakdown tables and trace collection guidance in the paper's evaluation + reproducibility sections.

- Updated reproducibility commands and documentation to highlight the new extended tracing capabilities.

### Changed

- Minor internal improvements to fast-path probe handling and observability parsing for richer measurement data.

### Documentation

- Updated `hoox-arxiv-paper*` (core + full), `arxiv-submission.md`, `A-reproducibility.tex`, and related sections to reference the richer hop/traces support and Smart Placement rationale.
- Implementation table now lists CLI v0.9.3.

## [0.9.2] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **formatBadge now matches the v0.9.0 CHANGELOG claim** (which the code hadn't implemented): the badge style is now "colored glyph + colored text" (Vercel / Linear style) — e.g. `✓ ok`, `✗ fail`, `⚠ warn`, `ℹ info` — instead of high-contrast background chips. `BADGE_STYLE` restructured to `{ icon, color, defaultLabel }`; default labels are lowercase to match the modern-minimal palette.

- **5 previously-failing tests now pass** (CI was red on v0.9.1):
  - `formatBadge > pads short custom text to 4 chars` — moot after the rewrite.
  - `formatHint > emits a dimmed hint line in rich mode` — test now clears `process.env.NO_COLOR` in its `beforeEach` (the local shell env had `NO_COLOR=1`, which made `isRichMode()` return false and the function bail).
  - `formatCompletion > renders success + message + duration in human mode` — same NO_COLOR fix.
  - `formatCompletion > renders a 'next: ...' line when a suggestion is provided` — same NO_COLOR fix.
  - `ConfigService > load() falls back to current directory when home config missing` — test now creates a real `wrangler.jsonc` in a tmp cwd and `process.chdir`s into it before calling `load()`. The code's "fall back to cwd" branch was never being exercised by the test.

- **Dev test suite no longer hangs `bun test` / `bun test --coverage`**. Root cause: `withErrorHandling` was calling `process.exit(1)` on caught errors, which killed the test runner mid-suite. The fix is the bigger one in "Changed" below — the wrapper now sets `process.exitCode` only.

- **3 pre-existing test bugs** surfaced by the now-functional coverage summary:
  - `registerConfigCommand > registers the 'config' command on the program` — assertion matched an outdated summary string.
  - `registerRepairCommand > repair worker <name> > calls deploy for the specified worker` — test was missing `ConfigService` prototype mocks for `load()` and `getWorker()`.
  - `registerFastpathCommand > rejects invalid --action values with exit code 2` / `rejects --n > 1000 with exit code 2` — tests mocked `process.exit` directly; the wrapper no longer calls it.

- **`format-mode.test.ts` ORIGINAL_ENV snapshot is now describe-scoped** (with `beforeAll`/`afterAll` symmetry) so cross-file test pollution from `process.env` mutations doesn't leak.

- **Coverage for `trace-service.ts` (1.79% → 100%)** — added 29 unit tests covering the constructor/credentials validation, `query` (events/calculations/invocations views), `queryEvents`, `queryMetrics`, `listKeys`, `listValues`, destinations CRUD, `getUsage`, live tail, and the `cfApi` error paths (HTTP error, network error, Auth header).

- **Coverage for `setup-service.ts` (35% → 99.89%)** — added 14 unit tests covering the actual execution paths: `generateKeys` (with real file writes), `applySchema` (spawn success/failure/missing schema), `setSecrets` (success and CloudflareService.putSecret failure), `rebuildDashboard` (build + deploy + missing dir), and `runAll` orchestration (all-flags, skip flags, failure path).

- **Coverage for `error-handler.ts` (44% → ~95%)** and **`prerequisites-command.ts` (30% → ~95%)** — added tests for `withErrorHandling` (all error branches + service name prefix) and `suggestForCommand` (short input, no match, close match, nested subcommand walk).

### Changed

- **Removed all 13 `process.exit()` calls** from `src/index.ts` and `src/utils/error-handler.ts`. Every error path now sets `process.exitCode = X` instead. A single `process.exit(process.exitCode)` in `main()`'s `finally` block is the only exit point. This is what fixes the dev test hang, and it also lets test runners intercept via Commander's `exitOverride` without monkey-patching `process.exit`.

- **Refactored `src/index.ts` (411 → 320 lines)**:
  - All 36 imports moved to a single block at the top of the file.
  - `hoox completion` extracted into its own folder: `src/commands/completion/{index.ts,completion-command.ts,completion-command.test.ts}` (5 new tests).
  - Dev/deploy preAction update hooks moved into `src/commands/dev/register.ts` and `src/commands/deploy/register.ts`, gated by a shared `src/utils/update-check.ts > attachUpdateCheck()` helper (4 new tests). Subcommand renames can no longer silently disable the check.
  - `(thisCmd as Command & { _hooxStartedAt?: number })` casts replaced with a module-level `WeakMap<Command, number>`.

- **Replaced dead `theme.corner` export** with a `theme.box` family of named primitives (`topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`, `horizontal`, `vertical`). `src/ui/banner.ts` now uses `theme.box.*` for its box-drawing characters instead of hand-rolling them with `theme.textFaint` (the Horizon variant keeps its inline rounded corners since those aren't in the square-corner set).

- **`bin/hoox.js` now falls back to `src/index.ts` when `dist/index.js` is missing**. The fallback lets contributors and CI jobs that haven't yet run `bun run build` still execute the CLI directly via `bun bin/hoox.js` or a `bun link`-based install. Production releases continue to build first (the `prepublishOnly` script enforces this).

- **`ConfigService.load` split into two methods**. New `tryLoad(configPath?)` returns `ConfigResult` — a typed `Result<HooxConfig, ConfigError>` with a discriminated `ConfigError` union (`not-found | invalid-jsonc | not-object`). The old `load(configPath?)` is preserved as a thin wrapper that throws with a clear English message — backward-compatible with the 15+ existing callers, but new code can use `tryLoad()` for explicit error handling. `ConfigError` is exported from `src/services/config/index.ts`.

### Added

- **Per-file coverage gate**: `bun run coverage:check` runs `scripts/check-coverage.ts`, which parses `coverage/lcov.info` and fails on any `packages/cli/src/**` file (excluding tests, barrel `index.ts` re-exports, and files < 10 source lines) below the 50% line-coverage floor. The floor is intentionally low so future PRs can ratchet it up incrementally as more files get tests. Wired into the root `package.json` scripts.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Banner version lookup broken in global install**: `ui/banner.ts` used a relative path (`../../package.json`) that works from source but not from the bundled `dist/index.js` in a globally-installed package. When the user ran `hoox` with no args, the banner tried to read `/path/to/install/@jango-blockchained/package.json` (which doesn't exist) and threw `ENOENT`. The fix walks up from `import.meta.url` looking for the hoox-cli `package.json` by name, working in both layouts.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added

- **New `--no-color` global flag** to disable all ANSI color output (alongside `--json` and `--quiet`).
- **`NO_COLOR` env var honored** (https://no-color.org standard).
- **`formatCompletion(message, { durationMs, suggestion })`** — new formatter that prints a "✓ Done in 1.2s" footer with an optional "→ next: hoox …" suggestion. Wired into the global `program` postAction hook.
- **"Did you mean …" suggestions** for unknown commands via Levenshtein distance. A typo like `hoox deplpy` now suggests `hoox deploy`.
- **Custom help formatter** — `hoox --help` and per-command `--help` render with sectioned layout (Usage / Options / Examples / See also) and refined colors.
- **`formatNumber(n)`** — compact notation (1.2K, 1.5M, 2.5B) used by `formatTable` number auto-alignment and by perf/monitor/trace.
- **`formatBytes(n, { binary? })`** — SI (KB/MB) or binary (KiB/MiB).

### Changed

- **Theme palette refined** to a modern-minimal aesthetic (zinc/slate base, single indigo-400 accent, de-saturated status colors). Visual change ripples through every command; information content unchanged.
- **Badge style** — `formatBadge()` no longer uses high-contrast background chips; now renders colored glyph + colored text (Vercel / Linear style).
- **Spinner** — uses braille dots (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`) instead of plain ASCII.
- **`formatTable` options** — now supports `zebra`, `alignNumbers`, `colorizeStatus`, `compact` (all default to on, except `compact` which defaults to off). Backward compatible.
- **`formatError` options** — now accepts `suggestions: string[]` and `inCard: boolean`. JSON output includes a new `suggestions` field.
- **Banner default** — now `minimal` (was `legacy`).

### Fixed

- **Banner version drift**: `ui/banner.ts` was hardcoded to `v0.3.0` while the package was at `v0.8.0`. Now reads dynamically from `package.json`.
