/**
 * Unit tests for `attachUpdateCheck`.
 *
 * Verifies that:
 *   - the helper attaches a preAction hook to each named subcommand
 *     (no throw when subcommands are present)
 *   - missing subcommand names are skipped (no throw)
 *
 * The hook's interaction with UpdateService is exercised end-to-end
 * by the dev-command integration tests — we don't mock the service
 * here because Bun's `mock.module` is hoisted at file-parse time and
 * doesn't reach the closure inside the helper.
