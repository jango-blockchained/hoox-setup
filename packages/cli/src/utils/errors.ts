/**
 * CLIError — structured error class for the Hoox CLI.
 * Provides exit codes, optional details, hint, and recoverable flag.
 *
 * - `hint` is a short, actionable follow-up message (e.g. "Run `hoox infra` to
 *   create the D1 database, then re-run `hoox setup`."). It's shown to humans
 *   below the error line and included in `--json` output as an additive field.
