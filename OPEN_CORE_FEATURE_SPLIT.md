# HOOX Open Core vs Enterprise Feature Split

This document defines the clear boundary between the **Open Core** (public, open source) and the **Enterprise** layer (commercial, closed source).

## Guiding Principles

- The **Open Core** must be independently useful and production-capable for retail / power users / small teams.
- The **Enterprise** layer adds the capabilities needed for institutions, funds, prop shops, and SaaS platforms (multi-tenancy at scale, compliance, support, advanced proprietary features).
- Architecture and design patterns are documented publicly (even for Enterprise features) to maintain credibility and support the academic paper.
- Code for Enterprise-only features lives in a separate private repository.

## Technical Boundaries

### `packages/shared`

- **Open Core**: Core types (`TenantContext` lightweight version), middleware, router, service bindings, analytics, errors, health checks, basic schemas.
- **Enterprise layer** (private): Full tenant management, billing primitives, advanced audit emitters, proprietary model interfaces, complex Workflow orchestration helpers.

We deliberately keep `packages/shared` relatively small and stable in the open core. Enterprise can extend it or maintain a private fork if needed.

### Workers

Most workers have an "open core" version and can be extended in the Enterprise layer (via composition, inheritance patterns, or separate deployment).

### Documentation

All architecture and design documentation is public, even when it describes commercial features. This is intentional for credibility and to support the academic paper.

---

## What This Enables

- Individuals and small teams can use a powerful, fully open source version.
- Institutions get a supported, compliant, multi-tenant platform with proprietary enhancements.
- The open source community and academic work continue to benefit from the core architecture.
- Commercial development can move faster without being constrained by open source obligations on the highest-value IP.
